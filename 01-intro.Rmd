## Background

This document is 
an attempt to clarify a few points related to the basics of R, RMarkdown, and
RStudio. R is not RStudio. R is not R Markdown. R Markdown is not RStudio. Now 
that this is out of the way, let's get started. We start with a few definitions.

1. [R](http://www.r-project.org) From the R Project's website, "R is a free
software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and 
runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS."
2. [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) From the RStudio website, "RStudio is an
integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console,
syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools
for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management." RStudio works on 
Mac, Windows, and linux. 
3. [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) RStudio's flavor of the markdown
language.

## R

R is the statistical programming language that we will use in this class. It's 
great for statistical programming because it was developed by statisticians;
it's not great for general purpose programming because it was developed by 
statisticians.

## Why R Markdown?

At its core, R Markdown is just another variant of
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org), developed by RStudio. As such, it 
helps to understand a little bit about Markdown, and we will get to that. 
First, we just point out that R Markdown allows the user to keep *all* of your
analysis code, output, and thoughts/comments/conclusions in a single 
document. In addition, R Markdown can be used to produce reports (Word, pdf,
HTML, github docs), dashboards, slides, among other types of output, *i.e.* R
Markdown is extremely flexible as a tool. 

## From R to R Markdown

I, though this is not gospel, tend to do preliminary work in a `.R` file, and 
then transfer that work to a `.Rmd` file once I'm happy with the work. 

## RStudio

We will use the RStudio IDE in this class to write code, manage our software
projects, etc. Seriously, if you are going to write code in R, use this IDE. I 
will demonstrate everything using a DU-hosted RStudio server in class.

## R Basics

We are going to focus on using R for statistical analysis and, as a result,
we will rely heavily upon the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org). There
is merit in using and learning "base" R, but I believe that the unified 
syntax presented in the tidyverse (and its many add-ons) allows us to focus on
the data wrangling, analysis, and output. If you are already familiar with 
base R, here is a [handy guide](http://www.significantdigits.org/2017/10/switching-from-base-r-to-tidyverse/)
for translating base R into tidyverse language. 

### Data Manipulation

```{r cars}
df <- read.csv("data/Advertising.csv")
```

```{r}
str(df)
```

Note that this `df` object is a "tibble", a more flexible data.frame in R. 


### Traditional indexing vs dplyr verbs

#### Traditional 

Suppose we want to select the TV column of `df`. There are a host of ways
that you can do this in base R, e.g. `df$TV` or `df[, "TV"]`, or `df[, 1]`
if you know that TV is located in the first column. The numeric indexing applies to 
both rows and columns. For example, suppose we want the first 5 observations from the
$2^{nd}$ and $3^{rd}$ columns of `df`. We can access this information by issuing 
`df[1:5, 2:3]`. Note that for two generic vectors `v1` and `v2`, we can get the `v1`
rows and `v2` columns from `df` by `df[v1, v2]`. 

#### dplyr

The [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) package (part of the tidyverse) provides a 
"grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you 
solve the most common data manipulation challenges:" `mutate()`, `select()`, 
`filter()`, `summarize()`, and `arrange`. I tend to think of dplyr as a SQL-like
syntax for R. For reasons that will hopefully become obvious as the quarter 
progresses, dplyr (and other packages) rely heavily on the "pipe" operator that was 
introduced in the [magrittr](http://magrittr.tidyverse.org) package. The best way to
learn dplyr is to do dplyr. 

## New R Markdown File

In order to create a new R Markdown document (.Rmd file), `File -> New File ->
R Markdown` within RStudio. A default template will show up in your text editing
window within RStudio. The template is customizable for your own needs, but it 
requires a little hacking around to do this. 

### R Markdown Document Structure

R Markdown documents (in the most basic form) will have three parts. 

1. YAML - Header information that includes title, author, date, and output type
(*e.g.*, pdf or HTML) at a minimum. An example YAML section might look like the
following text. 

```
---
title: "R Markdown, RStudio, and R"
author: "Ryan Elmore"
date: "`r format(Sys.Date(), '%d %b %Y')`"
output: 
  pdf_document
---
```

2. Markdown Code - Your section headings, lists, comments, conclusions, etc. is
all written in markdown. There are a million references online for learning
about markdown. Or just read my `.Rmd` documents for just about everything that
you would need to know re markdown (outside of YAML and R code chunks). 

3. R Code - The actual R part of your `.Rmd` document is embedded within what we
refer to as "code chunks". R can be placed inline, e.g. `` `mean(rnorm(50))` ``
would evalue the mean of 50 random normal variates within the document *e.g.*
`r mean(rnorm(50))`. The other way to insert R into a document is to include a
stand-alone chunk by using the three back ticks method, e.g. 

````
```{r, eval = FALSE}`r ''`
p <- ggplot(df_facet_plot, aes(x = budget, y = sales))
p + geom_point(col = "#6E0000") + 
  facet_grid(. ~ medium, scale = "free_x") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "black") +
  theme_bw()
```
````

The only R code in that previous text chunk is the stuff contained on the lines 
between the `` ``` ``, or the following text.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p <- ggplot(df_facet_plot, aes(x = budget, y = sales))
p + geom_point(col = "#6E0000") + 
  facet_grid(. ~ medium, scale = "free_x") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "black") +
  theme_bw()
```

I usually organize my `.Rmd` documents in the following way:

1. YAML heading
2. I will put an R code chunk at the top of the document with the packages that 
I refer to as the `lib`. 
3. After 2., I import any necessary data and call that code chunk `data`. 
4. I then weave text and R code chunks throughout the rest of the document.

### UN Votes Example

Assuming the `YAML` has been entered, I'll define the packages that are used.
Note that I am using the `knitr` option `INCLUDE = FALSE` so that this isn't
included in the final document.

```{r lib, eval = F} 
## This code chunk is not being evaluated but it's included in the doc.
library(dplyr)
library(unvotes)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r libs, include = FALSE}
## This code chunk is being evaluated but it's not included in the doc.
library(dplyr)
library(unvotes)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
```

Next, I'll either import and/or manipulate date and, again, I won't include 
this chunk in the document. See the `.Rmd` file for the data manipulation code.

```{r data}
df <- un_votes %>%
  dplyr::filter(., country %in% c("United States of America", "Australia")) %>%
  dplyr::inner_join(., un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") %>%
  dplyr::inner_join(., un_roll_call_issues, by = "rcid") %>%
  dplyr::group_by(., country, year = year(date), issue) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(
    votes = n(),
    percent_yes = mean(vote == "yes")
  ) %>%
  dplyr::filter(votes > 5) # only use records where there are more than 5 votes
```

Finally, I will write the document by weaving text with code. For example, 
Figure \ref{fig:un_issues} shows the percentage of "Yes" votes by each country 
for each issue over time.

### The Figure

### A small heading

#### even smaller

Here is my figure, boss. Thank you. 


```{r fig-un-votes, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7.5, fig.cap='\\label{fig:un_issues} Percentage of "Yes" votes by country on six issues over time.'}
p <- ggplot(df,
            aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country))
p + geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ issue) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2", labels = c("Australia", "U.S.A.")) +
  labs(
    title = "Percentage of 'Yes' votes in the UN General Assembly",
    subtitle = "1946 to 2015",
    y = "% Yes",
    x = "Year",
    color = "Country"
  ) +
  guides(col = F) +
  theme_bw()
```


## Extracting R Code

You can extract all of the R code and put it into an `.R` file using the
`purl()` function from the `knitr` package. The only way I know how to do this
is within the R Console window. As an example, suppose you have an R Markdown
file named `class-work-1.Rmd` and you want to extract all R commands to 
`class-work-1-r-commands.R`, you issue the following from the Console prompt.

Note that you could create a new `.R` file by simply `File -> New File ->
R Script`. This is simply a text file and the commands are entered into the R 
Console window. 

```
> knitr::purl(input = "class-work-1.Rmd",
              output = "class-work-1-r-commands.R")
```

1. [RMarkdown on RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
2. [RMarkdown Cheatsheet](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.html)

## Github

Log onto [Github](https://github.com) and create an account if you don't already 
have one. If you don't know what git is, how to use hit, etc., don't worry. Just
create an account and I will walk you through how to use it later.

### Happy Git

If you want to know more about Git than you'll ever need to know, check out this
reference, [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/index.html). Seriously, 
it's a great reference. Bookmark it. Read it. Know it. Or at least know the 
stuff contained in this document. 

### Configuration  

First thing is first, let's configure Git on the [RStudio server](https://rstudio.du.edu).
Connect to the server using your username 
`firstname.lastname` and password (Canvas password). Add your name and email 
address so that we can keep track of who makes commits. Note that your user.name
does not have to be your [Github](https://github.com), but your email address 
has to be the one that you use for Github. 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git config --global user.name 'Firstname Lastname'
git config --global user.email 'your github email goes here'
git config --global --list
```

### Create and Clone a Repository

#### Creation

Log onto github and create a new repository. Click the "Repositories" tab and
then the green "New" button (for New Repository) in the top right. Name this new
repository "test-repo". As an aside, most people refer to repositories as repos
in the revision-control world. Make the repo "Public" and initialize the repo 
with both a README and gitignore file (with R). Click on the big green "Clone or
download" button and use https. 

#### Cloning

Always remember, clones are people two. We are going to clone this thing using 
the terminal. Log onto the RStudio server and navigate to the terminal. You may
want to create a new directory (either from the terminal or RStudio file 
manager) and `cd` to that directory. Now clone the repo. Note that you will need
to specify your particular repo, i.e. it probably won't have `rtelmore` in there.

```{bash, eval = F}
git clone https://github.com/rtelmore/test-repo.git
```

Open up the README, make a small change and commit your change. Look at 
`git status` before and after and commit. 

```{bash, eval = F}
git commit -a -m 'initial commit'
git push origin master
```

Note, we do not want to type our username/password every single time we make a 
commit. Let's cache the password. We have to make sure that we are still working
on functioning repository. I will use `test-repo`. 

```{bash, eval = F}
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'
```

This will store your password for 10 million seconds, or about 115 days (plenty
of time for this class). You can figure out how many seconds you need until the
end of the quarter if you want. Here's a hint in R:

```{r, eval = T, message = F}
library(lubridate)
ymd("2019-03-19") - ymd("2019-01-08")
```

Edit the README again, and push your changes. 

```{bash, eval = F}
git commit -a -m "another change to README"
git push -u origin master
```

This should ask for your password and then it will be stored/cached so that 
future changes will not request your credentials. Note that the instructions 
for storing your password on your own machine (Windows or Mac) differ slightly
from what I've described above. Please see [this section](http://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html)
in Happy Git with R for detailed instructions. 

#### Projects in RStudio

We can do all of this commandline stuff in RStudio (either on your computer
or the server). Click on "File" -> "New Project" and a window will pop up. Click
on "Version Control" and then "Git" and you'll see the following dialog box. 

![Creating a project from a git repository.](fig/git-window.png)

Fill in the appropriate information for the `Repository URL`, 
`Project directory name`, and `Create project as subdirectory of`. If you leave
the middle field blank, it will default to the name given on Github. Hit 
`Create Project` and you will have a new project associated with this 
repository. Now you have a "Git" button on the top of your RStudio session and
can push, pull, commit, etc. directly from RStudio itself. 

As a matter of preference, I prefer to create repositories on Github and then
clone them into RStudio using the method I just described. You can certainly 
create the repo locally and push to Github, but you can have some problems in 
doing this - just trust me. See [this section](http://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html) of Happy Git with R for
more details. 

### Github SDP

Apply for the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
if you want access to a bunch of free software including unlimited private and 
public repositories.



You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

```{r data-manipulation, include = F}
df <- un_votes %>%
  dplyr::mutate(., rcid = as.numeric(rcid),
                rcid_plus_one = rcid + 1,
                rcid_plus_one_sq = rcid_plus_one^2)
un_votes_joined <- df %>% ## pipe operator
  dplyr::filter(., country %in% c("United States of America", "Australia")) %>%
  dplyr::inner_join(., un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") %>%
  dplyr::inner_join(., un_roll_call_issues, by = "rcid") %>%
  dplyr::group_by(., country, year = lubridate::year(date), issue) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(
    votes = n(),
    percent_yes = mean(vote == "yes")
  ) %>%
  dplyr::filter(votes > 5) # only use records where there are more than 5 votes
```

### UN Votes

#### Australia versus U.S.

Here is a figure showing the percent votes = yes for each of Australia 
and the United States by issue. This is Figure \ref{fig:au}. 

```{r usaus, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7.5, fig.cap='\\label{fig:au} Percentage of "Yes" votes by country on six issues over time.'}
p <- ggplot(un_votes_joined,
            aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country))
p + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ issue, ncol = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2", labels = c("Australia", "U.S.A.")) +
  labs(
    title = "Percentage of 'Yes' votes in the UN General Assembly",
    subtitle = "1946 to 2015",
    y = "% Yes",
    x = "Year",
    color = "Country"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```
