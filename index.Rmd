# Introduction

This website serves as a resource for my class on Advanced Predictive Modeling
using R at the University of Denver. The class is listed as INFO 4390 in the
Department of Business Information and Analytics, Daniels College of Business. 

I will assume that an introduction to regression analysis-type class has been 
taken prior to enrolling in this course. No R experience is necessary, though, 
it will make things easier.
